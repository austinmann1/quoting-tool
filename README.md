## Testing

The application includes comprehensive test coverage:

### Unit Tests
- `auth.test.ts`: Authentication service and user session management
- `quotes.test.ts`: Quote creation, retrieval, and calculations
- `configuration.test.ts`: Discount rules and pricing configuration

### Component Tests
- `App.test.tsx`: Core application routing and layout
- `LoginForm.test.tsx`: User authentication flow
- `QuoteForm.test.tsx`: Quote creation and editing
- `AdminPanel.test.tsx`: Administrative functions

### Integration Tests
- `App.integration.test.tsx`: End-to-end user flows
- Quote creation with automatic discount application
- PDF generation and download
- Admin panel operations


## Future Improvements

### Security & Authentication
- Replace local auth (credentials stored as plaintext) with Firebase Authentication

### Database & Storage
- Finish Salesforce integration using either:
  - OAuth2 for proper secure authentication
  - Connect through a backend API (more secure and allows all users access to the same DB)
- Alternative: Use Firestore


Run tests with:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Storage Options

The application supports two storage options:

### Local Storage (Default)
By default, the application uses browser local storage to store quotes and configuration. This is perfect for development and testing.

### Salesforce Integration (Beta)
The application can use Salesforce as a storage backend. Current status:
- Basic CRUD operations for quotes (create, read, update, delete)
- Quote storage in custom Salesforce objects

To connect to Salesforce:

1. Configure environment variables:
```bash
# Copy example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your Salesforce credentials
REACT_APP_STORAGE_TYPE=salesforce
REACT_APP_SF_LOGIN_URL=your-salesforce-instance
```

2. Set up Salesforce schema:
```sql
-- Required Custom Objects
Quote__c:
  - Name (Text)
  - Total__c (Currency)
  - Items__c (Long Text Area)
  - Status__c (Picklist)
```

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Demo Mode

For testing, use these demo accounts:

### Demo Accounts

You can use these accounts to test different user roles:

1. **Demo User (Individual Account)**
   - Username: demo@codeium.com
   - Password: demo123!@#
   - Features: Can view and create quotes

2. **Admin User (Enterprise Account)**
   - Username: admin@codeium.com
   - Password: admin123!@#
   - Features: Full access, including pricing management

3. **Student User (Student Account)**
   - Username: student@codeium.com
   - Password: student123!@#
   - Features: Can view and create quotes, eligible for student discounts

## Components

### QuoteForm Component (`/src/components/QuoteForm.tsx`)

The main quote creation interface with the following features:

#### State Management
```typescript
// Main state
const [quoteItems, setQuoteItems] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
const [totalAmount, setTotalAmount] = useState<number>(0);
const [subtotal, setSubtotal] = useState<number>(0);
const [discountApplied, setDiscountApplied] = useState<boolean>(false);
const [discountAmount, setDiscountAmount] = useState<number>(0);

// Reference for latest items
const latestItems = useRef<Record<string, string>>(quoteItems);
```

#### Key Functions

1. **Quote Calculation**
```typescript
const calculateQuote = useCallback(
  debounce((items: Record<string, string>) => {
    // Converts input to valid quote items
    // Calculates totals using backend service
    // Updates UI with new amounts
  }, 50),
  [resetCalculations]
);
```

2. **Input Handling**
```typescript
const handleUnitChange = (productId: string, value: string) => {
  // Validates input (numbers only)
  // Handles empty fields
  // Triggers recalculation
};
```

## Data Flow

1. User inputs unit quantities
2. Input validation occurs
3. Debounced calculation triggers
4. Backend service calculates totals
5. UI updates with new amounts
6. On save:
   - Quote is stored (localStorage in demo mode)
   - Form resets
   - Saved quotes list updates
